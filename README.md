OBJECTIVES
We have created our first software! We were tasked with creating a game that interacts with the user, using the functions and basic python resources we have learned during the week. Our game should be able to take an input from the user and provide an output.

INSTRUCTIONS
Mastermind is a difficult puzzle game, in which one player tries to guess the code their opponent comes up with. 


Here are the different steps of this game:
	1. 
Have the code maker select a code of 4 color pegs (among a list of 6 colors).
	2. 
Have the code breaker place her first guess
	3. 
Ask the code maker to give feedback
	4. 
The code maker gives clues about how good the guess was. He must be honest, and tells how many pegs have the correct color and are correctly placed and how many pegs have the correct color but are wrongly placed. 
	5. 
Continue until the code is guessed or there are no more guesses left (10 in total).




For this we have created
	* 
a function mastermind_attempt(choice): that will give feedback about the guess of the code breaker.
	* 
a class PrintInColor() that will print the different colors in their own color and
	* 
a function color_in_color() that writes the color in its own color.



The combination is generated randomly by the CPU. 

We have designed 2 levels (beginners and expert), Beginners combination won't have the same color twice whereas Expert level can have a color twice or three or four times. 

IMPROVEMENTS:

We need to add a quit function that allows the player to quit the game before the end.
We can improve the Beginners level by telling exactly the pegs that are correct or at least have the correct color.


(As requested, we used Trello to structure our work as shown in the screenshot below)
